# Blocks

From [drupal.org - Concept: Blocks](https://www.drupal.org/docs/user_guide/en/block-concept.html):

> Blocks are individual pieces of your site’s web page layout. They are placed inside the regions of your theme, and can be created, removed, and rearranged in the Block layout (admin/structure/block) administration page. Examples of blocks include the Who’s online listing, the main navigation menu, and the breadcrumb trail. The main page content is also a block.
>
> Some modules make new blocks available for placement on your site. For example, when the core Search module is installed and configured, it provides a block that contains a search form. You may also create and place your own custom blocks.
>
> Each block has its own configuration settings, which allow you to select which pages of your site will display the block. It is even possible to place multiple copies of a block, each with its own separate configuration and visibility rules.

## Block Management

Blocks can be found at `Structure` -> `Block layout`.

![Block List](images/block-list.png "Block List")

You can configure a specific block by clicking the `Configure` button next to that block.

## Block Visibility

You can configure a blocks visibility settings (i.e. where they will and won't show up), based on:

1. Language (If [Multilingual](2.8-multilingual.md) is enabled)

2. Content Type

3. Page

4. User Role

## Block Placement

You can either place a specific block into a region by configuring the block, or by clicking the "Place block" button for a particular region on the `Block layout` page.

## Programmatically Create a Block

1. Create & enable a module (my_block_example.info.yml containing name, type, core)
2. Create a Block Class my_block_example/src/Plugin/Block/MyBlock.php containing Annotation metadata and the 4 required methods
* build()
* blockAccess()
* blockForm()
* blockSubmit()
```
<?php

namespace Drupal\my_block_example\Plugin\Block;

use Drupal\Core\Access\AccessResult;
use Drupal\Core\Block\BlockBase;
use Drupal\Core\Form\FormStateInterface;
use Drupal\Core\Session\AccountInterface;

/**
 * Provides a block with a simple text.
 *
 * @Block(
 *   id = "my_block_example_block",
 *   admin_label = @Translation("My block"),
 * )
 */
class MyBlock extends BlockBase {
  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function build() {
    return [
      '#markup' => $this->t('This is a simple block!'),
    ];
  }

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  protected function blockAccess(AccountInterface $account) {
    return AccessResult::allowedIfHasPermission($account, 'access content');
  }

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function blockForm($form, FormStateInterface $form_state) {
    $config = $this->getConfiguration();

    return $form;
  }

  /**
   * {@inheritdoc}
   */
  public function blockSubmit($form, FormStateInterface $form_state) {
    $this->configuration['my_block_settings'] = $form_state->getValue('my_block_settings');
  }
}
```
The blockAccess() method allows you to define custom access logic. In our example, any user with the ‘access content’ will see the block.

Notice that we’re calling a method from the AccessResult class here. The static method allowedIfHasPermission will check if the current user (or anonymous) has access to view content (in this case).

3. Assign the block to a region and you should see it.
